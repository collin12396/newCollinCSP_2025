    "- Used ChatGPT and Copilot to understand unfamiliar code and fix syntax issues.\n",
    "- Created API endpoints to serve game data using Flask and JSON.\n",
    "- Hosted and tested live project with teammates, refining based on user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Glucoquest\n",
    "- Worked on: \"Glucoquest\" in trimester three  \n",
    "    - Dexcom Crossword  \n",
    "        - Stuck on the problem of the JavaScript function in frontend, specifically the chart of the crossword.  \n",
    "        - Fixed by editing the chart by hand to make sure the binary work.  \n",
    "        - Having trouble getting the comment and score recording API to work in frontend instead of only in Postman.  \n",
    "        - Fixed by working with Vibha and Anyi who pointed out I did not use the GET and POST functions correctly in the frontend.  \n",
    "    - Matching Feature  \n",
    "        - Initially struggled to make the frontend blocks function properly to record time and correctness in the correct order.  \n",
    "        - Fixed by breaking down the problem, testing small functions, and using console logs to track flow.  \n",
    "        - Encountered issues with syncing user feedback display with game logic timing.  \n",
    "        - Solved by adjusting asynchronous calls and state updates in JavaScript event handlers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Worked on: \"The Traveler Project\" in trimester two  \n",
    "    - Comment API  \n",
    "        - Struggled to integrate the comment API smoothly with frontend features.  \n",
    "        - Resolved by carefully debugging API requests and improving frontend-backend communication.  \n",
    "        - Faced challenges adapting the site for various screen sizes.  \n",
    "        - Fixed using flexible CSS grid layouts and media queries after extensive device testing.  \n",
    "    - Frontend Functionality  \n",
    "        - Unsure how to implement smooth scrolling navigation links.  \n",
    "        - Learned and applied the `scrollIntoView` method with event listeners to solve this.  \n",
    "        - Encountered version control conflicts from multiple teammates editing the same files.  \n",
    "        - Improved collaboration by using GitHub Issues and pull requests for better code management.  "
