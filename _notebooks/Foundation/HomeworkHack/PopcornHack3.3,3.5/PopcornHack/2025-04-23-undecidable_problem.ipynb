    "\n",
    "The **Post Correspondence Problem (PCP)** is a classic undecidable problem. Given two lists of strings over some alphabet (for example, A = [a1, a2, ..., an] and B = [b1, b2, ..., bn]), the task is to determine whether there exists a sequence of indices \\(i_1, i_2, ..., i_k\\) such that the concatenation of strings from list A equals the concatenation of strings from list B:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "a_{i_1} a_{i_2} ... a_{i_k} = b_{i_1} b_{i_2} ... b_{i_k}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no general algorithm that can decide for every input whether such a sequence exists. The Post Correspondence Problem is undecidable because it can simulate the behavior of a Turing machine. If it could be solved, it would imply the ability to solve the **Halting Problem**, which is known to be undecidable.\n"
