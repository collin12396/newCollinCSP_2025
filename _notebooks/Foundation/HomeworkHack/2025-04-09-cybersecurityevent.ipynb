    "- What is cybersecurity?\n",
    "- What is a zero-day vulnerability?\n",
    "- How do professionals navigate ethical issues in cybersecurity?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answers from Invited Professionals\n",
    "- Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks.\n",
    "- A **zero-day vulnerability** refers to a flaw in software or hardware that is unknown to the vendor or the security community, making it exploitable by attackers before any fix or patch is released.\n",
    "- To navigate ethical dilemmas, professionals first identify whether the situation involves a conflict of values, rights, responsibilities, or duties.\n",
    "  - Example: A conflict may arise between protecting user privacy and reporting security breaches to the public or authorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Notes\n",
    "- Cybersecurity threats include attempts to steal data.\n",
    "- When data theft occurs, professionals report the violation and work to move information to a safer location.\n",
    "- Companies can suffer serious damage from the loss of important information due to breaches.\n",
