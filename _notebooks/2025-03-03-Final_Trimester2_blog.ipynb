    "\n",
    "| Question Number | Correct Answer | My Answer | Reflection on Mistake | How to Fix |\n",
    "|-----------------|----------------|-----------|-----------------------|------------|\n",
    "| Question 11      | A | D | I got this one wrong because I don't understand how to get the RGB values from 2 and power calculations.  | Know I know that 1 represent there is a power, and it start to gradually going down. Such that 11110000 is from 2 to the 8th power to 2 to the 4th power. |\n",
    "| Question 18      | B | C | This code segment rotates the robot right three times until it is facing toward the top of the grid and there is a free space to its right. It then attempts to move the robot forward off the edge of the grid, causing execution to terminate. | I learned that for this question I need to look at the outside loop instead of focusing on the inner turning code. |\n",
    "| Question 24      | B | A | For this question, it is a careless mistake that I did the multiplication wrong. | I simply redo the calculations and get the correct values. |\n",
    "| Question 32      | D | C | I got this question wrong because this code segment subtracts the lowest score from the sum. It erroneously divides this result by the number of scores rather than one less than the number of scores. | This code segment takes the sum of the individual scores and subtracts the lowest score. To obtain the average, the result is divided by one less than the number of scores. |\n",
    "| Question 33      | A | D | This answer is wrong because the information can be determined by comparing each studentâ€™s original average to the course grade after the lowest score was dropped. | Now I know that I need the individual schools, otherwise the administrator is unable to determine any of the studentâ€™s individual scores other than the lowest score. |\n",
    "| Question 34      | C | D | I got this question wrong because I messed up the order that 1 suppose to be the first one than the second one. | I can improve by observing the code more carefully since the order of which lines of code run first matters a lot in a program. |\n",
    "| Question 35      | B | A | This question is very tricky because my choice was indeed similar to the correct answer but it does not generalize it. I got this one wrong mainly because I did not read the question carefully enough | I can improve by reading the question more carefully. |\n",
    "| Question 43      | C | B | I got this one wrong mainly because I have trouble understanding diagrams that have complex relationship with other components. | I know that B is the correct answer instead by comparing to other answers. It is possible to have redundant routing in both configurations. In configuration I, some possible routes between computers Q and V include Q-P-V, Q-T-V, and Q-R-S-V. In configuration II, some possible routes between computers Q and V include Q-S-V, Q-R-T-V, and Q-P-T-V. |\n",
    "| Question 44      | B | A | I got this one write because I ignore the relationship for U and V. | The correct relationship is if the connections between U and V and between U and P were removed, then computer T and computer U can no longer communicate. |\n",
    "| Question 57     | C | B | I did not understand what internet communication means, so I apply to the wrong definition to the answer. |  Protocols for Internet communication, such as TCP/IP, are intended to define a standard format for messages sent between devices on the Internet. This is the real intended purpose of internet communication. |\n",
    "| Question 67     | A and B | B and D | I got this question wrong because the wrong logic, If one value equal zero, then the corresponding value should also equal to zero. | I chose the answer b correctly but i missed the A. For this code segment,â€‡countâ€‡is increased toâ€‡1â€‡the first timeâ€‡\"birch\"â€‡is encountered in the list. However,â€‡countâ€‡is reset toâ€‡0â€‡when the code segment moves to the next list element. The last timeâ€‡\"birch\"â€‡is encountered in the list,â€‡countâ€‡is again increased toâ€‡1, causing the procedure to returnâ€‡1â€‡instead of the intended resultâ€‡2. |\n",

    "## 3. **General Insights**\n",
    "   - Overall, I think I did better than I expected because many of the question types are still unfamiliar to me when I first saw them.\n",
    "   - I maintain the good technique I used from the previous practicing MC. When I encounter a problem I am unfamiliar with, I will go and research about the similar topics online, or I revisit the notes I took on the big ideas. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. **Plans for Improvement**\n",
    "   - **Strengthen Understanding of Binary and RGB Values:** Practice converting binary numbers to decimal and understanding how RGB values are derived from bit patterns. Use interactive tools or coding exercises to reinforce the concept.\n",
    "   - **Improve Attention to Code Execution Order:** Focus on reading code carefully, paying attention to loops and conditions, and tracing execution step-by-step to avoid misinterpreting logic.\n",
    "   - **Enhance Debugging Skills for Mathematical Operations:** Rework problems involving calculations to avoid careless mistakes. Implement a habit of double-checking math operations before finalizing an answer.\n",
    "   - **Develop Stronger Diagram Interpretation Skills:** Spend more time analyzing complex diagrams and network routing problems. Use real-world examples and simulations to strengthen pattern recognition.\n",
    "   - **Refine Careful Reading Strategies:** Read questions more thoroughly before answering, especially for tricky wording. Underline or annotate key parts of the question to prevent misinterpretation.\n",
    "   - **Review Internet Communication Protocols:** Study protocols like TCP/IP in depth, ensuring clarity on their role in internet communication.\n"

I want to take courses that focus on full-stack development and algorithms, as they align with my current skills and future career aspirations. Internships and research opportunities will be valuable for gaining real-world experience and applying my knowledge in practical settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection on Individual Strengths and Weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**  \n",
    "One of my key strengths during this project was my ability to learn new concepts and tools that I was previously unfamiliar with. I was able to take those new learnings and apply them directly to the project, which helped the team deliver a more polished final product. For example, I quickly picked up on backend frameworks and deployed features like the comment system with the proper setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses:**  \n",
    "I recognize that I need to improve on organizing my language, particularly when it comes to asking questions or explaining complex topics. Sometimes, I struggle to communicate in a clear, structured way, which is something that computer scientists often excel at. This is an area I aim to work on to become more effective in both technical discussions and collaborations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection on Project and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The feedback we received from the **Night at the Museum** event highlighted areas where we could enhance the interactivity of our website. While the design and overall concepts are solid, we need to make our site more user-friendly and responsive. Our next steps will focus on improving user experience by incorporating interactive features based on the feedback. We initially wrote the \"story\" of the website with different identities in mind, and this feedback will help guide us in making the site more engaging and aligned with our initial goal.\n",

    "### Self Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I believe Iâ€™ve made strong progress in both individual learning and teamwork. I would rate my performance a 9.1 out of 10. While I am confident in my technical work and ability to adapt to new challenges, there are still areas, like communication and organization, that I aim to improve in the future.\n",
