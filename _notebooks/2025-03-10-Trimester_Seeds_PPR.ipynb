    "   - **Total Questions:** [67 Questions]\n",
    "   - **Completed Correctly:** [Answered 56 question correctly]\n",
    "   - **Total Score:** [56 / 67]\n",

    "## 2. **Question Breakdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Question Number | Correct Answer | My Answer | Reflection on Mistake | How to Fix |\n",
    "|-----------------|----------------|-----------|-----------------------|------------|\n",
    "| Question 11      | A | D | I got this one wrong because I don't understand how to get the RGB values from 2 and power calculations.  | Know I know that 1 represent there is a power, and it start to gradually going down. Such that 11110000 is from 2 to the 8th power to 2 to the 4th power. |\n",
    "| Question 18      | B | C | This code segment rotates the robot right three times until it is facing toward the top of the grid and there is a free space to its right. It then attempts to move the robot forward off the edge of the grid, causing execution to terminate. | I learned that for this question I need to look at the outside loop instead of focusing on the inner turning code. |\n",
    "| Question 24      | B | A | For this question, it is a careless mistake that I did the multiplication wrong. | I simply redo the calculations and get the correct values. |\n",
    "| Question 32      | D | C | I got this question wrong because this code segment subtracts the lowest score from the sum. It erroneously divides this result by the number of scores rather than one less than the number of scores. | This code segment takes the sum of the individual scores and subtracts the lowest score. To obtain the average, the result is divided by one less than the number of scores. |\n",
    "| Question 33      | A | D | This answer is wrong because the information can be determined by comparing each student’s original average to the course grade after the lowest score was dropped. | Now I know that I need the individual schools, otherwise the administrator is unable to determine any of the student’s individual scores other than the lowest score. |\n",
    "| Question 34      | C | D | I got this question wrong because I messed up the order that 1 suppose to be the first one than the second one. | I can improve by observing the code more carefully since the order of which lines of code run first matters a lot in a program. |\n",
    "| Question 35      | B | A | This question is very tricky because my choice was indeed similar to the correct answer but it does not generalize it. I got this one wrong mainly because I did not read the question carefully enough | I can improve by reading the question more carefully. |\n",
    "| Question 43      | C | B | I got this one wrong mainly because I have trouble understanding diagrams that have complex relationship with other components. | I know that B is the correct answer instead by comparing to other answers. It is possible to have redundant routing in both configurations. In configuration I, some possible routes between computers Q and V include Q-P-V, Q-T-V, and Q-R-S-V. In configuration II, some possible routes between computers Q and V include Q-S-V, Q-R-T-V, and Q-P-T-V. |\n",
    "| Question 44      | B | A | I got this one write because I ignore the relationship for U and V. | The correct relationship is if the connections between U and V and between U and P were removed, then computer T and computer U can no longer communicate. |\n",
    "| Question 57     | C | B | I did not understand what internet communication means, so I apply to the wrong definition to the answer. |  Protocols for Internet communication, such as TCP/IP, are intended to define a standard format for messages sent between devices on the Internet. This is the real intended purpose of internet communication. |\n",
    "| Question 67     | A and B | B and D | I got this question wrong because the wrong logic, If one value equal zero, then the corresponding value should also equal to zero. | I chose the answer b correctly but i missed the A. For this code segment, count is increased to 1 the first time \"birch\" is encountered in the list. However, count is reset to 0 when the code segment moves to the next list element. The last time \"birch\" is encountered in the list, count is again increased to 1, causing the procedure to return 1 instead of the intended result 2. |\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **General Insights**\n",
    "   - Overall, I think I did better than I expected because many of the question types are still unfamiliar to me when I first saw them.\n",
    "   - I maintain the good technique I used from the previous practicing MC. When I encounter a problem I am unfamiliar with, I will go and research about the similar topics online, or I revisit the notes I took on the big ideas. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. **Reflection on Test-Taking Strategies**\n",
    "   - **Elimination Method:** For many multiple-choice questions, I found that eliminating obviously incorrect answers helped me narrow down the choices, making it easier to arrive at the correct answer.\n",
    "   - **Time Management:** I paced myself well throughout the test, ensuring that I did not spend too much time on a single question. However, I could improve by leaving time to review flagged questions at the end.\n",
    "   - **Second-Guessing:** There were moments when I changed my answer upon reviewing, sometimes leading to corrections and other times causing me to switch from a correct to an incorrect answer. I will work on balancing my confidence in initial instincts with logical re-evaluation.\n",
    "   - **Handling Difficult Questions:** When encountering a particularly challenging question, I used a strategy of marking it and returning later rather than getting stuck and losing time. This approach helped me complete the test efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. **Plans for Improvement**\n",
    "   - **Strengthen Understanding of Binary and RGB Values:** Practice converting binary numbers to decimal and understanding how RGB values are derived from bit patterns. Use interactive tools or coding exercises to reinforce the concept.\n",
    "   - **Improve Attention to Code Execution Order:** Focus on reading code carefully, paying attention to loops and conditions, and tracing execution step-by-step to avoid misinterpreting logic.\n",
    "   - **Enhance Debugging Skills for Mathematical Operations:** Rework problems involving calculations to avoid careless mistakes. Implement a habit of double-checking math operations before finalizing an answer.\n",
    "   - **Develop Stronger Diagram Interpretation Skills:** Spend more time analyzing complex diagrams and network routing problems. Use real-world examples and simulations to strengthen pattern recognition.\n",
    "   - **Refine Careful Reading Strategies:** Read questions more thoroughly before answering, especially for tricky wording. Underline or annotate key parts of the question to prevent misinterpretation.\n",
    "   - **Review Internet Communication Protocols:** Study protocols like TCP/IP in depth, ensuring clarity on their role in internet communication.\n"

    "# PPR Requirements for College Board - Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "## PPR Requirements:\n",
    "1. **The code need to include a list being created/stored in a list**\n",
    "2. **The code segment also need to show the list being processed**\n",
    "3. **The code also need a function with parameters and sequencing, selection, iteration**\n",
    "4. **Lastly, the code need to call to the function at the end**\n",

    "### 1. A List Being Created/Stored in a List\n",
    "\n",
    "In the provided code, a list of comments is created and stored. This list, named `comments`, holds multiple `Comment` objects that contain text data. These objects are instantiated with specific comment values, and the list stores them for further processing or database interaction. This list creation ensures that multiple comments can be handled together as a collection.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def initComments():\n",
    "    with app.app_context():\n",
    "        c1 = Comment('I like to travel around the world')\n",
    "        c2 = Comment('I usually travel in Asian countries')\n",
    "        comments = [c1, c2]  \n",
    "        \n",
    "        for comment in comments:\n",
    "            try:\n",
    "                comment.create()\n",
    "            except IntegrityError:\n",
    "                '''fails with bad or duplicate data'''\n",
    "                db.session.remove()\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### **What each code does here**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **A list named `comments` is created**  \n",
    "   - `comments = [c1, c2]` stores multiple `Comment` objects in a list.\n",
    "   - This ensures multiple comments can be processed together.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Each item in the list is a `Comment` object**  \n",
    "   - `c1 = Comment('I like to travel around the world')`  \n",
    "   - `c2 = Comment('I usually travel in Asian countries')`  \n",
    "   - These objects hold text values and represent individual comments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The list is then processed using a loop**  \n",
    "   - `for comment in comments:` iterates over the list to process each comment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Each comment is saved using `comment.create()`**  \n",
    "   - This demonstrates how stored data in the list can be accessed and used.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. A List Being Processed\n",
    "\n",
    "The second requirement is demonstrated when the list of comments is processed. In the API, the list of comments retrieved from the database is processed one by one. Each comment is added to an array, which can then be returned as a response in the API. This allows for handling each individual item within the list, performing actions like extracting the comment text, and then preparing it for output or further interaction with the system.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class _BULK_CRUD(Resource):\n",
    "    def get(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        Retrieve all comments.\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        comments_array = [] \n",
    "        for comment in Comment.query.all():  \n",
    "            comments_array.append(comment.comment)  \n",
    "        return jsonify(comments_array)  \n",
    "```\n",
    "#### **what each code does**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The list `Comment.query.all()` is retrieved**  \n",
    "   - `for comment in Comment.query.all():` fetches all the `Comment` objects from the database.  \n",
    "   - This represents a list of all the comment records stored in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Each item in the list is processed individually**  \n",
    "   - The loop iterates over each comment in the retrieved list.  \n",
    "   - `comments_array.append(comment.comment)` extracts the `comment` field (the text) from each `Comment` object and appends it to a new list, `comments_array`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The list is modified (processed) by extracting text**  \n",
    "   - The text of each comment is extracted using `comment.comment` and added to the `comments_array`.  \n",
    "   - This is how the original list of `Comment` objects is processed to extract relevant data (the comment text).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The processed list is returned as a JSON response**  \n",
    "   - Finally, `return jsonify(comments_array)` converts the list of comment texts into a JSON response, making it available for API consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. A Function with Parameters and Sequencing, Selection, Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "The third requirement is met with the `create()` method within the `Comment` class. This method involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**:  \n",
    "   The `create()` function takes parameters when a `Comment` object is instantiated. For example, `Comment('I like to travel around the world')` passes the comment text as a parameter to the `__init__` method.  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   c1 = Comment('I like to travel around the world')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "- **Sequencing**: The function follows a sequence: first, the comment is added to the session with `db.session.add(self)`, and then it is committed to the database using `db.session.commit()`.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   db.session.add(self)\n",
    "   db.session.commit()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "- **Selection**: An error-handling mechanism is used to select whether the comment can be added to the database or if it should be rolled back in case of issues (like duplication). This is done with the `except IntegrityError` block, which ensures that if an error occurs during the commit, the transaction is rolled back using `db.session.rollback()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "except IntegrityError:  \n",
    "    db.session.rollback()\n",
    "    return None\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Iteration**: The `initComments()` function iterates over the list of comment objects, calling the `create()` method for each one. This ensures that each comment gets processed and added to the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Code chunks**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Comment(db.Model):\n",
    "    __tablename__ = 'comments'\n",
    "    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n",
    "    comment = db.Column(db.Text)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self, comment):\n",
    "        self.comment = comment  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    def create(self):\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            db.session.add(self)  \n",
    "            db.session.commit()  \n",
    "            return self\n",
    "        except IntegrityError:  \n",
    "            db.session.rollback()\n",
    "            return None\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The initComments() function also contains iteration, as it loops over the list of comments to create each comment object:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def initComments():\n",
    "    with app.app_context():\n",
    "        comments = [c1, c2]  \n",
    "        \n",
    "        for comment in comments: \n",
    "            try:\n",
    "                comment.create() \n",
    "            except IntegrityError:\n",
    "                db.session.remove()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. A Call to the Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The final requirement is met when the `initComments()` function is called within the application. This function is responsible for initializing and storing a set of comment objects in the database. By calling this function, the system begins the process of adding predefined comments to the database, which simulates the creation and storage of comments within a real-world application.\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def initComments():\n",
    "    with app.app_context():\n",
    "        c1 = Comment('I like to travel around the world')\n",
    "        c2 = Comment('I usually travel in Asian countries')\n",
    "        comments = [c1, c2]\n",
    "\n",
    "        for comment in comments:\n",
    "            try:\n",
    "                comment.create()\n",
    "            except IntegrityError:\n",
